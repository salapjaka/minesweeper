MineSWEEPER 

Assumptions:
10x10 grid
10 mines(bombs)
You can only win by flagging all the bombs (for now)
You can flag as many bombs as you want. Incorrect bomb marking doesnâ€™t kill you, but it can
lead to mistakes that do
If one bomb is clicked, all of them are revealed and you lose
The timer never maxes out - take your time, but hurry up;)

Quick start:
Please use Google Chrome
When the game starts, the bombs are randomly placed on the field
Each bomb is surrounded by numbers
Each number indicates the number of bombs in adjacent squares
Some guess work may be necessary:)
To restart the game - click on the mean smiley

Improvement in mind:
Add score
Add levels
Add another winning option by opening all the numbers instead of marking bombs
